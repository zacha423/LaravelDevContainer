# LaravelDevContainer
A basic DevContainer for developing applications using Laravel. PHP, Composer, and XDebug are preinstalled for you.  
A docker-compose file has already been created to add additional services (Nginx, PostgreSQL) as needed.  
# First Steps
1. Run `composer create-project laravel/laravel MyProject` to create your first project.  
2. Then use `php artisan serve` to view your project.
